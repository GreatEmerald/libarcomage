The backend library for card games, where two players use resources to play 
cards with a variety of effects that help build their own tower or destroy the 
opponent's tower as quickly as possible.

The library written in D, and uses Lua scripts to allow users to easily create 
new cards or card decks, or to alter the computer AI. These changes apply to any 
frontend to the library.

Install a frontend, like DArcomage or CLArcomage, to be able to actually play.
