The list of things that are still to be done in Arcomage Clone goes here.

- Finish the selection highlighter feature.
- Finish the original card support.
- Clean up the code.
- Make it documentation-friendly.
- Make the number of cards in hand configurable.
- Create a card dock so you could see the cards played in the past. Divided in two for MArcomage.
- Make cards rendered by assembling them instead of rendering a still image.
- Add GUI support for modifying the configuration.
- Create a screen showing the game rules.
- Add randomisation of configuration options.
- Introduce particles.
- Finish porting stuff to Lua.
- Start working on MArcomage support.
- Fix bug: victory screen not displayed

Plan for the new GUI:
- The resolution is not restricted, except for a minimum requirement of VGA.
- VGA will be a little different from SVGA in that it will have special buttons.
- Cards will have tooltip support - they will be rendered on top of everything when the mouse curson is on top of them.
- Keywords will also have tooltip support. If one tooltip is active, the other can activate.
- If there is no need for a tooltip to appear, it will still appear - saves development time.
- Cards will be rendered as either originals in VGA mode or scaled down HD versions everywhere else.
- Using SDL_Resize (AKA resize) for that. Might be slow.
